# meal-app


hello in this prpoject i have created a site that fetches data from mealDB api.

index.html is the front page/ home page and i have created 2 more pages one for favourites (favourites.html) in which we cand keep the track of meals which we have added
to the favourites .

I am using local storage to store the favourites meals.

meal.html file is used to show all the details and instructions about the meal and ingredients about the meal , i have used local storage for keeping the meal info too. 

2 local storage variables are being used one for favourites and one for meal.html page which shows the meal info. mealids(for favourites) and id(for single meal info page).
